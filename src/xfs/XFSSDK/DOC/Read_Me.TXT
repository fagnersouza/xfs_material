The XFS specification documents detail the interface to 
the various device classes and the contents of these 
documents are immutable. However it should be noted that 
the CEN committee may occasionally release notes in order 
to clarify parts of the specification. These addendums 
are stored in a clarifications document that is freely 
available from the CEN XFS web site.
